> **Lien Chen** *2020-07-29*

With start run vscode, it run out a notification which say "The TypeScript language service died 5 times right after it got started. The service will not be restarted.".

Get solutaion with [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/88497).
Just go to the extension and install **Javascript and Typescript Nightly**, restart the vscode and finally clear the error.
